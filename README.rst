Overview
=========

Telemeta is a free and open source collaborative multimedia asset management software which introduces useful and secure methods to archive, backup, transcode, analyse,  annotate and publish any digitalized video or audio file with extensive metadata. It is dedicated to collaborative media archiving projects, research laboratories and digital humanities - especially in ethno-musicological use cases - who need to easily organize and publish documented sound collections of audio files, CDs, digitalized vinyls and magnetic tapes over a strong database, in a secure platform and in accordance with open web standards.

Key features:

* Secure archiving, editing and publishing of audio files over internet.
* Pure HTML web user interface including dynamical forms and smart workflows
* Smart dynamical and skinnable audio player (thanks to  TimeSide and  SoundManager2)
* "On the fly" audio analyzing, transcoding and metadata embedding based on an easy plugin architecture
* Social cumulative indexing with semantic ontologies and timecoded markers
* Multi-format support : FLAC, OGG, MP3, WAV and more
* User management with individual desk, lists, profiles and rights
* Playlist management for all users with CSV data export
* Geo-Navigator for audio geolocalization
* High level search engine
* DublinCore compatibility
* OAI-PMH data provider
* RSS feed generators
* XML and ZIP serialized backups
* SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle DB backends
* Multi-language support (now english and french)
* Video support (EXPERIMENTAL, WebM only)

This web audio CMS is exclusively based on open source modules and can be run on any Unix or Linux system.
It is mostly written in Python and JavaScript.

The processing engine of Telemeta is provided by `TimeSide <https://github.com/yomguy/timeside/>`_, an open web audio processing framework written in Python.

Install
=======

Thanks to Docker, Telemeta is now fully available as a docker composition ready to work. The docker based composition bundles some powerfull applications and modern frameworks out-of-the-box like: Python, Numpy, Gstreamer, Django, Celery, Haystack, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Redis, uWSGI, Nginx and many more.

On Linux, first install `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, `Docker engine <https://docs.docker.com/installation/>`_ and `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ and open a terminal.

On MacOSX or Windows install the `Docker Toolbox <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox>`_ and open a Docker Quickstart Terminal.

Then run these commands::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Parisson/Telemeta.git
    cd Telemeta
    docker-compose up db

Press CTRL-C to exit (the last command is needed to init the database).

Start
=====

For a production environment setup::

     docker-compose up

Then browse the app at http://localhost:8000/ (replacing 'localhost' by the IP given by the docker terminal on OSX or Windows)

For a development environment setup::

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f env/dev.yml up

Then browse the app at http://localhost:9000/ (replacing 'localhost' by the IP given by the docker terminal on OSX or Windows)

To start the application in DEBUG mode::

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f env/debug.yml up


Backup / Restore
================

To backup the database in the data/backup/ folder, run this in **another** terminal (or a Docker Quickstart Terminal)::

    docker-compose run db /srv/scripts/sql/backup_db.sh

To restore the last backuped database from the data/backup/ folder, run this in **another** terminal (or a Docker Quickstart Terminal)::

    docker-compose run db /srv/scripts/sql/restore_db.sh

If the app is broken after a restore script, restart the composition with::

    docker-compose restart
